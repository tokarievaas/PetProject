# PetProject
Pet Project
The main idea behind this project is to create a portal where people would be able to create and maintain collections of their favorite media titles, such as movies they watched or music they listened to. This would allow them to easily recommend certain content to somebody without struggling to remember the name of the movie (or band or singer). Only titles and some related data can be added, not content. 
So, the current functionality allows: 
  1.	Unregistered users to view the page about me and the media collection of the Demo user.
  2.	Register and log in to be able to start maintaining your own collections: to add, modify and delete new items.

The implementation of REST Service is available by link â€“ (In current version it returns default user collection)
